            <p> In the diagram, the blue line labeled &quot;I&quot; represents a ray of light 
approaching the flat mirror. This ray of light is known as the <b>Incident Ray</b>. The line &quot;R&quot; is the light that is reflected off of the mirror, which is 
known as the <b>Reflected Ray</b>. At the point at which the light strikes the 
surface of the mirror, a perpendicular line &quot;N&quot; can be drawn. It is called 
                the <b>Normal Line</b>, which divides the angle between the incident and reflected ray into two angles. The angle between the Incident Ray and the Normal Line is called the <b>Angle of Incidence</b>. The angle between the Reflected Ray and the Normal Line is called the <b>Angle of Reflection</b>. They can also be written as &quot;i&quot; (theta-i) or &quot;r&quot; (theta-r), respectively. According to the <b><u>Law of Reflection</u>, when a ray of light reflects off of a surface, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.</b></p>
