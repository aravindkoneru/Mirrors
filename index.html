            <p>Insert image</br></br>This is where things get sticky! First, lets take a look at <b>concave mirrors</b> and some of the vocabulary that comes along with it. 
<b>Principal Axis</b>: Imagine that the mirror is an arc of a larger sphere. The Principal Axis is the center of this sphere attached to the mirror. 
<b>Center of Curvature</b>: The center of the sphere.
<b>Vertex</b>: The Vertex is also the geometric center of the mirror. It is the point on the principle axis that touches the surface of the mirror.
<b>Radius of Curvature</b>: The distance from the Vertex to the Center of Curvature-or the radius of the sphere. 
<b>Focal Point</b>: The point halfway between the Vertex and Center of Curvature.
<b>Focal Length</b>: The distance between the Vertex and the Focal Point, which is equal to one half of the radius. 
Now its your turn! See if you can name the parts of the diagram. (The variables are hints) </p>

            </br></br>
            <p>Associated with Concave mirrors are two key rules. </br>
            <b>First</b>, any incident ray of light traveling parallel to the principal axis will reflect off 
            the mirror and converge at the focal point. </br>
            The <b>second</b> is the oppositeâ€”any incident ray of light travelling through the focal point 
            will reflect off of the mirror and go in directions parallel to the principle axis.</br> </p>

            <p> In the diagram, the blue line labeled &quot;I&quot; represents a ray of light 
approaching the flat mirror. This ray of light is known as the <b>Incident Ray</b>. The line &quot;R&quot; is the light that is reflected off of the mirror, which is 
known as the <b>Reflected Ray</b>. At the point at which the light strikes the 
surface of the mirror, a perpendicular line &quot;N&quot; can be drawn. It is called 
                the <b>Normal Line</b>, which divides the angle between the incident and reflected ray into two angles. 
            The angle between the Incident Ray and the Normal Line is called the <b>Angle of Incidence</b>. 
            The angle between the Reflected Ray and the Normal Line is called the <b>Angle of Reflection</b>. 
            They can also be written as &quot;i&quot; (theta-i) or &quot;r&quot; (theta-r), respectively. 
            According to the <b><u>Law of Reflection</u>, when a ray of light reflects off of a surface, 
            the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.</b></p>
