     The day before winter break was a cold one. However, with our passion for physics we made it into a hot one. In deciding the topic of our presentation, we considered, what would be fun, educational, and highly appealing to our peers. The first thing that came to mind were applications of every day objects. In the end, we decided that mirrors, a common household item, would be a ideal object to enlighten the class of its cool and interesting physics properties. We spent winter break brain storming and researching our topic with a newfound fervor. Additionally, we met three times over the break to bring our ideas together into a cohesive coalition of scientific knowledge. In terms of actually splitting up the work, however, we adopted a workload similar to the one that we used previously. With the addition of Stone Wang to our group; however, we were further able to effectively split up the work into 4 parts, allowing us to divide and conquer our task.

     Jonathan and Aravind had prior experience in computer science, so they were delegated to working on the interactive diagram and creating the website. As a group, we decided that the website that was used in the last project was sub-par and that it had to be re-written. So this time, the entire website was written from scratch and carefully modeled to appeal to everyone within the group. While Jonathan and Aravind worked on the interactive elements, Stone and Eric worked tirelessly to research and compile the information in a concise and informative way. They used diagrams to illustrate their ideas and make the information easier to understand. Stone and Eric also make sure to cite all of the sources while researching to ensure that credit was given to the right sources. By diligently working from the day that the project was assigned, the group was able to finish the project one day in advance and relax the night before.
