            <p>Using our knowledge of mirrors and the Law of Reflection, we made a small interactive diagram for your 
            enjoyment that illustrative soem of the concepts you should have read and understood the basic concepts in the 
            <a href="../index.html">Learn</a> page. The red lines from the bottom up are the incident ray and the reflected ray,
            and the dashed line is the normal line. Have fun!</p>
            </br></br>
            
            <p>Directions: Click above or below the black line to increase or decrease the measure of the incident angle, respectively.
